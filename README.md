## Lab4
Create the following topology using customized topology file:
Everything follows shortest path.
When there are two shortest paths available,ICMP and TCP packets take the upper/right path while UDP packets take the lower/left path. 
Some hosts cannot have HTTP traffic (TCP with port:80), new connections are dropped with a TCP RST sent back to them.
Some hosts cannot have UDP traffic, simply drop packets at switches.
